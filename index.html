          <div id="schedule-nix-roadmap">

            <p>
              In this talk I'll discuss the state of the NixOS project and
              future plans. These include things like:
              <ul>

                <li>Improved containerisation. In principle, the combination of
                  Nix and Linux kernel namespaces / systemd provides a really
                  powerful way to containerize services (including their
                  state!), but we're not there yet.</li>

                <li>Closure size reduction. Nix closures are rather fat at the
                  moment, which is particularly annoying if you want to build
                  light-weight containers. Nix's multiple output support has
                  been around for a while to allow a huge size reduction, so
                  it's time to start using it everywhere.</li>

                <li>Distributed binary caches and reproducible builds. It would
                  be fantastic if binaries could be produced in a distributed,
                  P2P fashion, but this introduces an obvious trust problem. So
                  you may only trust binaries that have signatures from
                  multiple independent sources. But this requires bit-precise
                  reproducibility.</li>

                <li>Better Nixpkgs package abstractions. For instance, there
                  currently is no discoverability for package options (unlike
                  NixOS module options). So we need something better than the
                  current mkDerivation/callPackage paradigm.</li>

                <li>Policy issues. For instance, what packages / modules should
                  be accepted in the repository?</li>

                <li>How to deal with upstream packages that provide Nix
                  expressions or NixOS modules.</li>

                <li>And whatever else I can think of. Input is welcome! Please
                  let me know if there are topics you would like to see
                  discussed.</li>

          <div id="schedule-python-packaging">

            <p>Python packaging is one of the oldest packaging ecosystems. We
            will look into how Python currently works in Nix, what are caveats
            using the current state and what are short-term and long-term
            possible solutions moving forward.</p>

            <p>I will assume you have basic Nix language familiarity and build
            on top of that.</p>

          <div id="schedule-make-nix-friendlier-for-beginners">

            <p>Nix concepts and ideas are revolutionary. All of us who use
            Nix/NixOS on daily basis understand how it works and why it works
            this way. But it took us quite some time to get here.</p>

            <p>Users just starting with Nix/NixOS are facing many problems,
            which range from Documentation, UX of our command line tools,
            Interacting with community, ... and many other areas.</p>

            <p>I would like to share my views how we can make Nix/NixOS
            friendlier to beginners without much effort.</p>

          <div id="schedule-haskell-infrastructure">

            <p>The Nixpkgs infrastructure for Haskell packages has evolved over
            the course of several years, and the result of that process is
            a fairly sophisticated machinery that few people understand in its
            entirety. The purpose of this presentation is to take a look inside
            of that infrastructure and to explore ...</p>

            <ul>
              <li>how Cabal files are converted to Nix build expressions,</li>
              <li>how the "haskell-packages.nix" file is generated,</li>
              <li>how configurations for different compiler versions are implemented,</li>
              <li>how deep-overriding works in Haskell package sets, and</li>
              <li>how the generic builder works and what options exist to tweak it.</li>  
            </ul>

            <p>For each of these topics, we'll discuss the current solution,
            the motivation for the choices underlying that solution, and the
            known issues and limitations. </p>

            <p>The targeted audience are experienced Nix hackers with some
            understanding of Haskell's Cabal build system. Beginners should be
            able to follow most of the talk too, though, as we'll focus on
            algorithms and structure rather that spending our time reading
            code. Instead, the presentation is intended to enable its audience
            to read (and modify!) the code themselves afterwards.</p>

            <p>In this talk I'll discuss how we used Nix in production at
            Fynder - a London-based startup building a simple booking system
            for independent fitness instructors. We'll look at how Nix is used
            to create development environments to write Haskell code, and how
            these definitions can be re-used for production deployments and
            continuous integration with Hydra. We'll also look at how NixOS and
            NixOps are used to create deployment specifications.</p>

            <p>Ok, let's make this straight, for those who might think that
            nixos is just a toy you eat for breakfast.  What about running
            google kubernetes on a deticated cluster? full of nixos machines!
            in production! with virtualized networking and distributed storage!

          <div id="schedule-disnix">

            <p>In the Nix project, we strive to fully automate deployment
            processes for many kinds of systems, such as individual packages
            (Nix) and entire system configurations (NixOS) while providing
            a number of important quality attributes such as declarative,
            reliable and reproducible deployment.</p>

            <p>Lately, the microservices paradigm gained a lot popularity and
            it is also desired to automatically deploy such systems that are
            composed of distributable units, which may have a number of
            complicated technical and non-functional requirements.</p>

            <p>Moreover, we also want to have the same or similar deployment
            quality properties as the Nix package manager while deploying
            them.</p>

            <p>In this talk I'll show Disnix, a Nix-based service deployment
            tool that can be used to automatically deploy service-oriented
            systems into networks of machines and I will explain its underlying
            concepts. </p>

            <p>Additionally, I will show a number of public hands-on example
            cases each covering a specific deployment objective/property (such
            as heterogeneous network deployment, service compositions and
            deployment planning) and a real-world deployment scenario combining
            several of these aspects.</p>

          <div id="schedule-assembling-socs-with-nix">

            <p>The semiconductor industry is highly automated; building a SOC
            is very similar to building a software package.</p>

            <p>Except the build times are weeks instead of minutes.</p>

            <p>
              Nix has a feature set well suited for taming this flow:
              <ul>
                <li>manageability: derivations are first class data types, can be sub-typed </li>
                <li>declarative: easy to reason and abstract</li>
                <li>purity: reproducibility, binary caches</li>
                <li>flexible: convert what is delivered into inputs that can be used</li>
                <li>configuration: fine grained dependency management</li>
                <li>speed: caching and sharing of precious build results</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              With nixcad, we use nix to develop, verify, and assemble a real
              SoC:
              <ul>
                <li>30 different derivation types</li>
                <li>start to finish ~300 steps</li>
                <li>design of ~20 sub-blocks</li>
                <li>verification of sub-blocks</li>
                <li>integration of sub-blocks, external IP</li>
                <li>logic synthesis, STA, power calculation, and static checks</li>
                <li>final delivery closure sizes of 8GiB</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Partitioning:
              <ul>
                <li>tools: a layer on top of nixpkgs for EDA tools.</li>
                <li>cadenv: tool-agnostic drivers for simualtion, synthesis, FEC, STA, Place and Route, power calculation</li>

          <div id="schedule-f-micro-services">

            <p>This talk/demo walks participants through the process of setting
            up and deploying a small web service written in the FSharp
            programming language. It is intended for novice to intermediate
            NixOS and FSharp users and those interested alike.</p>
 
            <p>I will begin with a brief introduction to F# and some
            fundamental concepts and ideas of the language. This will not go as
            deep as explaining Mon ads in F#, but will provide some overview of
            common idioms and styles.</p>

            <p>Next, I will demonstrate how to set up a project using
            a publicly available template and the build environment
            (Emacs/evil, also the MonoDevelop IDE) and move on to live-coding
            a small web service in F# using the Suave.io framework.</p>

            <p>Finally, the newly created application will be deployed locally
            using a custom nix expression and a systemd service to
            manager/monitor it.</p>

            <p>A partitioner that allows for fully declatarive storage
            specification and is thus able to turn the currently running system
            into NixOS without losing data.</p>

            <p>While this is generally useful even for non-NixOS distributions,
            it's especially useful for bootstraping NixOS on various dedicated
            server hosters and/or other situations where direct hardware access
            is not available.</p>

            <p>This talk describes the possible use cases of it and the
            technical details about the implementation.</p>

            <p>In this talk, we will give an overview of the usage of Nix
            within LogicBlox. For 4 years, we have used Nix to improve our
            build, test and deployment infrastructure, and we are using NixOS
            heavily in production. We would like to highlight why we feel Nix
            is awesome and give some insight in how we are trying to give back
            to the Nix community.</p>

          <div id="schedule-shipping-security-updates">

            <p>In the Internet era, we have to ship security updates in a matter
            of hours.  The way we manage security updates today does not scale,
            and it is bound by a critical path. In order to reduce, the
            round-trip, we deliberately excluded most of the packages.</p>

            <p>This presentation introduces a new way to handle security updates,
            in a manner which can scale with the number of computer in the
            buildfarm.  Thus delivering updates as fast as each project can
            re-compile.</p>

            <p>An unconference, also called OpenSpace conference is
            a participant-driven meeting. The term "unconference" has been
            applied, or self-applied, to a wide range of gatherings that try to
            avoid one or more aspects of a conventional conference...

            session, sometimes called a data blitz...
